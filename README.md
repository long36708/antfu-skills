# Anthony Fu's Skills

A curated collection of [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home) reflecting [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s preferences, experience, and best practices, along with usage documentation for the tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a proof-of-concept project for generating agent skills from source documentation and keeping them in sync.
> I haven't fully tested how well the skills perform in practice, so feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Use this Project to Generate Your Own Skills

If you want to generate your own skill sets like this, you can use this project as a template.

1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Update `meta.ts` to add your own projects and skills.
4. Run `nr sync cleanup` to remove the existing submodules and skills.
5. Run `nr sync init` to clone the submodules.
6. Run `nr sync sync` to sync the vendored skills.
7. Use your agent to ask "generate skills for <project>" to generate the skills. It's recommended to do it one-by-one as this might consume quite a lot of tokens.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed generation guidelines.
